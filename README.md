# NFT Merge Contract

## Project Title
NFT Merge Contract

## Project Description
The NFT Merge Contract is a smart contract designed for the Soroban blockchain, aimed at enabling users to merge NFTs in a decentralized and secure manner. The contract allows users to combine two or more NFTs into a single NFT with a unique ID, offering the ability to manage and track merged NFTs efficiently. It enhances user interaction by providing an easy-to-use mechanism to merge NFTs, making it a valuable tool for managing digital collectibles on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
The vision of the NFT Merge Contract is to provide a seamless and efficient way for users to merge their NFTs, giving them more flexibility in managing their digital assets. It seeks to promote user empowerment and enhance the value of digital collectibles by enabling users to create unique merged NFTs while maintaining transparency, security, and decentralization in the process.

## Key Features
- **Merge NFTs**: Users can merge two or more NFTs into a new, unique NFT with a distinct ID.
- **NFT Tracking**: The contract keeps track of the merged NFT and its history, including the original NFTs involved.
- **Ownership Management**: Ownership of merged NFTs is clearly tracked and updated upon successful merges.
- **Decentralization**: The process is entirely decentralized, ensuring that no central authority controls the NFT merging process.

## Future Scope
- **Advanced Merging Logic**: Future versions of the contract can allow users to define the rules for how NFTs are merged, such as rarity-based merges or attribute-based merges.
- **Additional Features**: Integration of more complex features such as NFT burning, staking, and reward systems for merged NFTs.
- **Multi-chain Support**: Future development may include support for multi-chain functionality, allowing NFTs to be merged across different blockchains.
- **Improved User Interface**: A front-end interface that makes it easier for users to interact with the smart contract and merge their NFTs without needing to interact with the blockchain directly.
